## **React Frontend for Task Management**  
Developed by **Adithya Rajendran**  

This project involves building a **React-based User Interface** for the **Spring Boot Backend** previously implemented. It enables users to create, search, and manage tasks, where each task represents a shell command to be executed. The backend stores task data in **MongoDB**, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for seamless interaction.  

### **Installation & Running the Application**  
```sh
npm install  # Install dependencies  
npm start    # Start the React development server  
```  

### **Application Overview**  

#### **Home Page (Task Management Dashboard)**  
The main dashboard allows users to:  
- Search for tasks by name.  
- Create new tasks by specifying an ID, name, owner, and command.  
- View existing tasks along with their execution status.  

#### **New Task Component**  
This form enables users to create new tasks by providing:  
- **Task ID**
