# Consumer Complaint Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on the Consumer Complaint Dataset from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of consumer complaints about financial products and services, submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It includes features like complaint type, company name, and issue details.

## Project Overview
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Cleaning, visualizing, and summarizing the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building machine learning models to predict complaint categories or outcomes.

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## Execution
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`consumer_complaints_analysis.ipynb`) to reproduce the results.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using deep learning.
- Implement real-time complaint classification.
- Enhance data preprocessing techniques.
