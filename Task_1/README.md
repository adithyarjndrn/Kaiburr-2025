# Java backend and REST API


This Java backend application was developed as part of the Kaiburr Internship Selection Process. It serves as a task manager API that enables users to create, update, delete, and execute shell commands. Each task includes an ID, name, owner, command, and execution history, all stored in MongoDB.

Upon task creation or update, the application executes the command, captures the output, and stores execution details such as start time, end time, and result.

Users can interact with the API via REST endpoints using cURL, Postman, or a frontend interface.

Additionally, the application includes command validation to prevent execution of harmful commands (e.g., `rm -rf`).
